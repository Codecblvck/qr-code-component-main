## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box

### What I learned

- Flex-box for Centering Layouts:
I learned how to use display: flex along with justify-content and align-items to center elements both horizontally and vertically. This made my layout look clean and centered on any screen size.

 ```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
 ```
- Responsive Design with Media Queries:
I practiced using media queries to adjust layout and font sizes for different screen sizes, ensuring that the design remains readable and balanced across devices.

 ```css 
 @media (min-width: 1440px) 
 { .container { max-width: 400px; } }
  ```
 - Typography and Spacing:
I paid attention to font sizing, weight, and line-height to improve readability. I also learned how important consistent spacing (margins and padding) is to visual clarity.

- Reusable CSS and Clean Structure:
I focused on organizing my CSS well—grouping styles logically, avoiding repetition, and using consistent naming to keep the file readable and scalable.

- Visual Polish with Transitions:
I experimented with adding small hover effects and transitions to improve user interaction and give the design a more refined look.


### Continued development

**here are some areas i would like to continue learning**

- Responsive Design: Continue improving layout adaptability across all screen sizes.

- Typography: Refine font scaling and hierarchy for better readability.

Spacing & Layout: Practice consistent padding and margins for cleaner designs.

- CSS Structure: Write modular, reusable, and organized CSS.

- Transitions: Use subtle hover effects to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flex-box Guide-CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use Flex-box to center elements both horizontally and vertically. The visuals made it easy to grasp how each property behaves.


- [Responsive Web Design Basics – MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This article was essential for learning how to make layouts responsive using media queries. I’ll definitely refer back to it in future projects.
